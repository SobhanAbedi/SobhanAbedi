## Hello There 👋
Welcome to my GitHub Page. My name is Sobhan Abedi.
<br/>Here you can find a mixture of my personal projects and university assignments.

## About me
My journey in programming started with MS Basic in sixth grade (2012) at Allameh Helli Middle School. Ever since, I've been fascinated with logic, structure, and automation that computers bring to our lives.
After that, I went on to study Digital Logic, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning Basics. <!-- During which my projects were awarded first and second positions in two consecutive years in the field of computer science. -->

I started my B.Eng. in Biomedical Engineering in 2018 at Amirkabir University of Technology (ATU) and entered a dual-degree program in Computer Engineering in 2020. Currently, I'm working on my bachelor's Thesis in the field of Vision Transformer networks.

In 2018 summer, I got my first 3D Printer (an Ender3), and during the past 5 years, I've been tinkering with its Mechanics and Electronics to the point that now I have thousands of hours of experience in CAD/CAM and multiple experiences with register level programming for Integrated Circuits. Currently, I'm designing and building an open-source 3d printer based on Voron Trident.

## Work Experiences
I've had a wide range of interests and during the past three summers, I Interned in three different fields

### <a href="https://mci.ir/web/business-en/iot">Hamrahe Aval (IRMCI)</a> and <a href="https://ut.ac.ir/en">University of Tehran</a> (2021 summer)
In this internship, I worked on the design of an IOT communications system and fundamental libraries for it based on MQTT and HTTP protocols targeting simple AVR and Espressif microcontrollers.

### <a href="https://sinamed.ir/">SinaMed</a> (2022 summer)
SinaMed specializes in robotic surgery equipment. There I worked on the simulation of blood flow during incision in robotic surgeries using Unity Engine.

### <a href="https://cs.ipm.ac.ir/">IPM School of Computer Science</a> (2023 summer)
During this internship, I studied and worked under PD.FELLOW Hajar Falahati in the field of Human Emotion Detection and Efficient Neural Networks.
