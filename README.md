## Hello There ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my Github Page. My name is Sobhan Abedi.
Here you can find a mixture of my personan projects and university assignments.

## About me
My journey in programming started with MS Basic in sixth grade (2012) at Allameh Helli middle school. Ever since I've been facinated with logic, structure and automation that computers bring to our lives.
